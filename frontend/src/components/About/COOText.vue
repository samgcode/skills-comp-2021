        <p class="max-w-xl pt-3" data-aos="fade-left">As Jennifer was growing up, he was always the first kid out the door and the last kid in. 
                                    Jennifer spent most of her youth being raised outdoors at the lake. 
                                    Her values and love of fresh air stemmed from those days at the lake with her Grandparents. 
                                    Growing up in Alberta, nature, fresh air and the great Canadian Rocky Mountains were never hard to find.</p>

                                    That passion and love for nature will carry on through the products and our premium air that we will be delivering to you.
