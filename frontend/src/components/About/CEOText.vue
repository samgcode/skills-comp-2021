                                    His story began as a struggling university student. 
                                    Someone who couldn't focus on school as he was distracted and fascinated with commerce, specifically e-commerce.</p>
        <p class="max-w-xl pt-3" data-aos="fade-right">Mr. Blam. enjoys e-commerce as he feels it helps to make the world a smaller place. 
                                    With the Internet, we are able to reach farther than ever before, 
                                    and Mr. Blam is able to help others he wouldn't otherwise have been able to help!</p>
        <p class="max-w-xl pt-3" data-aos="fade-right">Shortly after Fred completed his education at the University of Alberta in the School of business, 
                                    personal interests quickly took over. He ran a very successful security business, 
                                    but mainly dedicated his time in helping people secure mortgages in the finance world.</p>
        <p class="max-w-xl pt-3" data-aos="fade-right">With Fred's passion on providing fresh clean air to everyone, 
                                    he has decided to put all of that aside and initiate a business that will allow people from all over the world to experience health and wellness. 
                                    Health and wellness they otherwise would not have been able to experience on a daily basis. With RapidAir, 
                                    we are able to bring a essential necessity, such as fresh clean air to anyone, anywhere.</p>
